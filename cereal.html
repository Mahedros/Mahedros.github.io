    So I put the onions in my cereal.
    Having done so there was really only one thing left to do:
</p>
<p>
    Make more weird cereal and set up a totally rigorous, highly scientific ranking of all my weird creations.
    All testing is done with raisin bran crunch, with milk, and with no cooking unless specified.

            Sweet cereals are a thing. Cereals with almonds in them are a thing. Sugar, raisins, nuts, and granola is basically just trail mix. What a surprise, this is pretty good.

            It's really important to remember how little effort goes into the preparation here. Maybe this wouldn't be terrible if I bothered to try and really mix the miso into the milk. But we don't do that here. The problem is, when you just drop a spoon of miso into the cereal and give it a quick stir, what you end up with is chunks of miso. This means some spoonfuls will have no miso and taste like normal cereal, and others will taste like pure, undiluted miso. This is not good.

            Maybe this could be higher if I liked ketchup to begin with, but I can't imagine it would be that much higher. Even by ketchup standards I hated this.
