    So I put the onions in my cereal.
    Having done so there was really only one thing left to do:
</p>
<p>
    Make more weird cereal and set up a totally rigorous, highly scientific ranking of all my weird creations.
    All testing is done with raisin bran crunch, with milk, and with no cooking unless specified.

            Not a huge surprise, but this is excellent. Garam masala is just really good, and that doesn't change just
            because you put in cereal. If you're not a Maryland cult member maybe this is the best one.

            If what I said about garam masala was not enough, this is just reinforcement of that idea. The spices of indian cuisine

            First things first, it tastes good. It wouldn't surprise me if this wasn't everyone's thing, but it works for me.
            I'll also have to admit to feeling a bit dumb here, in that I thought to myself "whoa, I can really smell this in each spoonful"
            before remembering that they're "Aromatic" bitters. Going to attribute that to just not being fully awake in the morning
            so I can feel better about myself.

            Sweet cereals are a thing. Cereals with almonds in them are a thing.
            Sugar, raisins, nuts, and granola is basically just trail mix. What a surprise, this is pretty good.

            After the success of orgeat, a different sweet syrup seemed like a reasonable thing to try.
            Pomegranate doesn't work as well as almond, but all things considered this was still pretty good.

            Not a huge impact on flavor, but it fits in well from a textural perspective.
            Crunchy peanuts don't feel out of place with crunchy cereal, and the light salting
            isn't unwelcome.

            Here it is, the one that started it all. As bad as raw onion in cereal sounds,
            this really had less of an impact on things than I expected.
            The impact of onion is more on texture than flavor, and that impact isn't particularly unpleasant.

            Like with onion, this has very little impact on flavor.
            There's a textural change, and the spoonfuls that included bits of pepper
            tasted a bit more watery than those without.

            <br />
            From sight alone I knew this would be bad. Mixing pasta sauce with milk results in a very unappetizing shade
            of pink that is not great for one's appetite. Unfortunately, things don't get better from there.
            Tomato in cereal isn't good, and the texture of the chunkier parts of the sauce are everything you don't want
            in a bowl of cereal.

            The big lesson to take away from a lot of the entries at the bottom is that umami does not work well in cereal.
            Miso should have taught me that, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and attributed that failure to my not
            putting any effort that goes into these. This really put the nail into the umami coffin. Don't do this.

            After miso and MSG, I knew this would be bad. I learned my lesson, umami doesn't work.
            But a friend requested this for the list, and I am a man of the people.
            It was every bit as bad as I thought it would be.

            <br />
            It's really important to remember how little effort goes into the preparation here.
            Maybe this wouldn't be terrible if I bothered to try and really mix the miso into the milk.
            But we don't do that here. The problem is, when you just drop a spoon of miso into the cereal
            and give it a quick stir, what you end up with is chunks of miso.
            This means some spoonfuls will have no miso and taste like normal cereal,
            and others will taste like pure, undiluted miso. This is not good.

            Maybe this could be higher if I liked ketchup to begin with, but I can't imagine it would be that much higher.
